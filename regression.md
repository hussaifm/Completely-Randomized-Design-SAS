# Regression Analysis with SAS
Heart Disease dataset from Kaggale
I picked 3 statistical models: simple linear model, two-way ANOVA with interaction and two-way ANOVA without interaction. 

# 1. Simple linear regression model

Research question: Are cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure related?
I will use this Statistical Model:Yi=α+βXi+ɛi

Dependent Variable: chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl). 

Independent variable: trestbps (resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

Statistical hypothesis (HT): β = 0
Analyzing the data: 

*Results*: from the tables below. 
1)The slope of trestbps is 0.36402 and the corresponding p-value is 0.0321.

2)The correlation p-value is also 0.0321 which is similar to the p-value to the slope and the correlation coefficient is 0.12317.

*Conclusion*: 
1)The pvalue is < 0.05, we reject the HT and there is relationship between the cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure. Also, because the slope is positive then the relationship is positive between cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure.

2)We can conclude again that there is relationship between cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure. Moreover, the goodness of fit is not very good, the R squared is 0.0152.
